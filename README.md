# Who are we

Well... we are you, us and every single one on this planet. 
It is our responsibility to carefully use resources provided by nature. Therefore, it is up to us to define standards we all share on how to use those resources. 
So this collaberation space is not about us, or a single person. It's about now, the future and how we act.
